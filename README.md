# PRODIGY_DS_Task2


1. import pandas as pd: This line imports the Pandas library, which provides data structures and tools for data manipulation and analysis. It is a common convention to import Pandas with the alias pd to make it easier to reference in code.

2.import numpy as np: This line imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations in Python. Similar to Pandas, it's imported with the alias np.

3.import seaborn as sns: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library that works on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It's often imported with the alias sns.

4.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. This line specifically imports the pyplot module from Matplotlib, often used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It's commonly imported with the alias plt.

5. df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\train.csv'): This line reads the 'train.csv' file related to the Titanic dataset from the specified file path (C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\train.csv) and stores it as a Pandas DataFrame named df. This file likely contains training data for a machine learning model, including features and the target variable (like whether passengers survived or not).

6.df1 = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\test.csv'): This line reads the 'test.csv' file related to the Titanic dataset from the specified file path (C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\test.csv) and stores it as another Pandas DataFrame named df1. This file typically contains similar data to the training set but without the target variable; it's used to evaluate the model's performance.

7.gs = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\gender_submission.csv'): This line reads the 'gender_submission.csv' file related to the Titanic dataset from the specified file path (C:\Users\Hp\Downloads\titanic\gender_submission.csv) and stores it as a Pandas DataFrame named gs. This file often contains a simple submission format where predictions (such as survival predictions for passengers in the test set) need to be submitted in a particular format.

8.df: This is the name of the Pandas DataFrame that was previously created by reading data from a CSV file, likely containing information about passengers from the Titanic dataset.

9..head(10): This is a method in Pandas that retrieves the first few rows of a DataFrame. By specifying the number 10 within the parentheses, you're requesting the first 10 rows of the DataFrame df.

10.df: This refers to the Pandas DataFrame that contains the Titanic dataset or a subset of it.

11..isnull(): This is a Pandas DataFrame method that checks each element of the DataFrame and returns True if the value is missing or False if the value is not missing. This generates a DataFrame of boolean values where True represents a missing value and False represents a non-missing value.

12..sum(): This function, applied after .isnull(), calculates the sum of the boolean values along each column. In Python, boolean values like True are considered as 1 when summed, and False as 0. So, summing these boolean values effectively counts the number of True values (missing values) in each column.

13.df['Age']: This selects the 'Age' column from the DataFrame df.

14..fillna(): This is a Pandas method used to fill missing values in a DataFrame or Series. In this case, it's being applied to the 'Age' column.

15.df['Age'].median(): The .median() method calculates the median value of the 'Age' column. This median value will be used to fill in the missing values.

16.df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median()): This line of code combines the above steps. It fills the missing values in the 'Age' column with the median age value calculated from the non-missing values in the same column. After filling in the missing values, the updated values are assigned back to the 'Age' column in the DataFrame df.

17.Count: The number of non-null (valid) values present in that column.
18.Mean: The average value of the data in that column.
19.Standard Deviation (std): A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the values.
20.Minimum (min): The smallest value in the column.
21.25th percentile (25%): The value below which 25% of the data falls.
22.50th percentile (median or 50%): The value below which 50% of the data falls (also known as the median).
23.75th percentile (75%): The value below which 75% of the data falls.
24.Maximum (max): The largest value in the column.

25.sns.pairplot(df1): The pairplot function in Seaborn creates a grid of axes such that each numeric column in the DataFrame df1 is plotted against every other numeric column. It shows scatterplots for joint relationships and histograms for univariate distributions on the diagonal. This plot allows for a quick examination of the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

26.plt.show(): In Matplotlib, plt.show() is used to display the visualization that has been created. When you've prepared the plot using Seaborn or Matplotlib functions, plt.show() is called to render and show the plot.

27.sns.pairplot(df, hue='Survived'): The pairplot function from Seaborn is used to create a grid of plots based on the DataFrame df. The hue parameter is set to 'Survived'. This parameter allows you to color the data points in the plots based on the values in the 'Survived' column. Since 'Survived' likely contains categorical data (0 for not survived, 1 for survived), using it as the hue parameter will color the data points differently based on whether the passenger survived or not.

28.plt.show(): As before, this line displays the plot created by Seaborn.

29.plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)): This line initializes a Matplotlib figure with a specific size. It sets the size of the upcoming plot to be 10 units wide and 5 units tall.

30.sns.histplot(df[df['Survived'] == 1]['Age'], label='Survived', kde=True): This uses Seaborn's histplot function to create a histogram. It focuses on the 'Age' column of the DataFrame df for passengers who survived (df['Survived'] == 1). It sets the label as 'Survived' for this histogram and includes a kernel density estimation (kde=True) to show the estimated probability density function of the age distribution.

31.sns.histplot(df[df['Survived'] == 0]['Age'], label='Did not survive', kde=True): Similarly, this line creates another histogram using Seaborn's histplot function. This time, it focuses on the 'Age' column of passengers who did not survive (df['Survived'] == 0). It sets the label as 'Did not survive' and includes a kernel density estimation (kde=True).

32.plt.legend(): This line adds a legend to the plot to differentiate between the two histograms ('Survived' and 'Did not survive').

plt.show(): This displays the histogram plot created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
